# Project Goals for simpledirstat

## Overview
**simpledirstat** is a command-line utility designed to provide a clear and concise view of disk usage on Linux systems. It aims to mimic the functionality of graphical tools like WinDirStat and K4DirStat, but in a simple, command-line format that can be used in scripts and other automation.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Disk Usage Visualization
- Provide a hierarchical view of disk usage, allowing users to quickly identify which files and directories consume the most disk space.
- Output should be easy to read and interpret, with options to sort by size, file type, or directory.

### 2. Performance Efficiency
- Optimize disk scanning to handle large filesystems efficiently.
- Ensure that the tool can run quickly even on systems with extensive directories and files, minimizing CPU and memory usage.

### 3. User-Friendly Interface
- Support command-line arguments to customize the scan, such as excluding certain directories or focusing on specific file types.
- Include help documentation accessible via a command-line argument that explains how to use the tool and its options.

### 4. Portability and Compatibility
- Ensure compatibility across various Linux distributions.
- Maintain the application in a way that it can be easily ported to other Unix-like operating systems with minimal changes.

### 5. Scalability and Extensibility
- Design the software to be easily extendable, allowing for additional features like graphical output or integration with other tools in the future without major restructuring.
- Support for plugins or modules that could extend functionality without altering the core codebase.

### 6. Reliability and Maintainability
- Follow best practices in coding to ensure that the application is stable and maintainable.
- Set up a thorough testing framework to automate testing of key functionalities, ensuring that each component behaves as expected.

## Secondary Goals

### Documentation and Community
- Develop comprehensive user and developer documentation to facilitate ease of use and contributions from the community.
- Establish a method for users and developers to provide feedback and contribute to future versions of the software.

## Conclusion
The project aims not only to fulfill the immediate needs of displaying disk usage efficiently but also to build a foundation that fosters community involvement and future development. The focus is on creating a robust, efficient, and user-friendly tool that can serve both casual and power users.
